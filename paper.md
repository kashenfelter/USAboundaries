# Summary

`USAboundaries` provides historical boundaries from 1629 to 2000 for states and counties from the Newberry Library's "Atlas of Historical County Boundaries," as well as historical city population data from Erik Steiner's "United States Historical City Populations, 1790-2010." It also provides contemporary state, county, and Congressional district boundaries, as well as Zip Code Tabulation Area centroids. These historical and contemporary boundaries are provided at different resolutions suitable for national and state-level mapping. A consistent interface provides a way to easily select historical boundaries for any specific date. The package includes helper functions and datasets, including tables of state names, abbreviations and FIPS codes for joining to attribute date as well as functions and date to get State Plane Coordinate System projections as EPSG codes or PROJ.4 strings.
